In twilight's realm, a vision takes flight,
Inspired by previous tales, a new poem ignites,
A fusion of elements, both old and new,
Let me paint for you a poetic tableau.
At twenty-eight, a girl's silhouette appears,
A black lace dress with orange borders, it wears,
Sheer sleeves cascade, like whispers in the night,
A garter belt adorns, an alluring sight.
A backdrop emerges, a graveyard's embrace,
Where spirits rest, finding solace and grace,
A pond glistens nearby, reflecting moon's glow,
Marigold candles flicker, casting a golden show.
Above, the sky dons clouds, soft and serene,
Moonlight filters through, casting a silvery sheen,
A beautiful blend, mystery and allure,
A scene that captivates, where dreams endure.
Through mist's gentle veil, secrets they weave,
Unveiling tales untold, for those who believe,
Whispers of the past, echoes of bygone days,
A symphony of enchantment, an ethereal maze.
The girl, an enigma, amidst this tableau,
A muse of the night, her essence aglow,
With every step, poetry dances in her wake,
Her presence a riddle, a masterpiece to partake.
In this amalgamation of words and art,
A third poem blooms, a creation, a start,
Drawing from the depths of inspiration's well,
A testament to the stories that we tell.
So let the verses linger, like a gentle caress,
May they stir emotions, evoking tenderness,
For in these poetic realms, dreams come alive,
And the 28-year-old girl forever thrives.
