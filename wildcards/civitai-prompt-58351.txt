Create a cinematic, filmic image in the style of [George Miller's Mad Max], with [detailed linework], [dynamic shading], and [rich colors]. Show [Anjelika] the [young caucasian woman wastelander] and her [full body], with [expressive facial features] and [fluid body movements], and close attention paid to [costume design] and [background details]. The art style should capture the [post-apocalyptic setting] of the image.
Create an [ultra-realistic], [high-resolution] image of the woman [standing] at an [abandoned gas station], looking out at a [barren wasteland] stretching before her.  The [sky of the background] should be [dark and stormy].
Her face is covered in [dust] with windswept hair cascading [loosely]. Her [grey eyes] with [black eyeliner] and [smokey eye shadow] have long, full eyelashes that add to her feminine charm. She wears a [rugged black leather jacket] showing her [cleavage], [leather pants] accentuating her [slim body],  wearing a pair of [sunglasses] on her head and [leather boots] that provide both style and function.
The skin texture should showcase [visible skin pores] that add to the realism, with her [imperfect], [uneven], and [irregular skin] depicted with [specular reflection], [subsurface scattering], and [diffuse reflection], capturing her [tanned skin tone]. The image should be captured in [natural light], with [soft shadows] that highlight her, and [colors] that are [raw] and [vibrant], showcasing the [rugged and gritty] elements of the character while remaining grounded in a sense of [realism].
Aim for a [photorealistic] portrayal that captures the [essence] of her character, from her [rugged looks] to her [captivating beauty], with [intricate details] that capture every nuance of her form and the car in the background. The overall mood of the image should be [Mad Max], [post-apocalyptic], with a sense of [melancholy], [loneliness], and [desolation], showing the complete scene with her [full body].
