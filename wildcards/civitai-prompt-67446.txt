 Craft an exquisite masterpiece that captures the emotional essence of riding a train through the enchanting midnight hours. The scene should evoke a sense of mystery, solitude, and contemplation. As the train glides through the urban cityscape, the lighting should reflect the enigmatic nature of the late-night streets. Depict dimly lit streets and scattered city lights that create a captivating play of shadows and highlights. Paint it in the style of Edward Hopper, embracing the realism that brings forth a deep connection with the scene. Each brushstroke should convey the stillness and melancholy of the late-night atmosphere, allowing the viewer to immerse themselves in the quiet solitude of the journey. Utilize a color scheme dominated by deep blues and purples, capturing the essence of the night, with hints of warm city glow adding depth and atmosphere. Let the painting be a true masterpiece, capturing the emotions that arise when riding a train through the captivating veil of the midnight hour.
