Extremely detailed and ultra - realistic full body illustration of Captain America as a Mandalorian, his helmet retaining the trademark winged A design of his classic mask, blended seamlessly with the traditional Mandalorian T - visored helmet. The helmet's reflection captures the intensity of the battle scene around him. He's holding his iconic shield, which now shows a blend of vibranium and beskar steel aesthetics, reflecting the world around him in its polished surface. His posture is vigilant and ready for combat. The backdrop is a gritty, smoke - filled battlefield under an overcast sky, as if rendered by Unreal Engine 5, giving a tangible sense of looming danger and high stakes. This piece carries an anime influence as inspired by the Niji model, adding a stylized edge to the hyper - realism. Portrait orientation with a ratio of 9: 16 completes the epic composition., <lora:difConsistency_photo:1>, <lora:difConsistency_detail:0.65>
