(masterpiece, high resolution RAW photo, visual storytelling:1.4) an alluring nymph stands amid scenic waterfall in forest glen, dressed in gossamer shift diaphanous as mists and raven tresses trailing into clear azure pool, kohl-rimmed eyes gazing coyly at the onlooker over bare shoulder; shallow depth of field focusing on her sylphlike poise balanced upon moss-covered stones and porcelain limbs caressed by cascading veil of water, scenic woodscape vista stretching endlessly under opalescent sky at twilight yielding first glimmer of stars awakening; escaping temporal bounds this vision yields glimpses of arcane rites and life unfettered by celestial fetters, feminine mystique and eternal longing for mortal souls enticed by siren song into her sylvan domain untouched by time.
