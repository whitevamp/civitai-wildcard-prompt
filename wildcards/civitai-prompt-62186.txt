Create an [ultra-realistic], [high-resolution] filmic image,  of [anjelika] standing on [battlefield] between [humans] and [machines] at [night]. The scene should be set in the midst of a [desolate], post-apocalyptic [landscape], with [mountains of rubble] and debris stretching as far as the eye can see. The [ground] is [littered] with the [remains] of countless [machines] and human [soldiers]. The [sky] is a [bleak] and [ominous] shade of gray, with [thick clouds] of smoke and dust hanging low in the air.
Her face is covered in [dust] with windswept hair cascading [loosely]. Her [grey eyes] with [black eyeliner] and [smokey eye shadow] have long, full eyelashes that add to her feminine charm. She wears a [tactical vest], [cargo pants] accentuating her [slim body] and [combat boots].
The skin texture should showcase [visible skin pores] that add to the realism, with her [imperfect], [uneven], and [irregular skin] depicted with [specular reflection], [subsurface scattering], and [diffuse reflection], capturing her [tanned skin tone]. Her face should be [detailed] and [highres]. The image should be captured in [natural light], with [soft shadows] that highlight her, and [colors] that are [raw] and [vibrant], showcasing the [rugged and gritty] elements of the character while remaining grounded in a sense of [realism].
Aim for a [photorealistic] portrayal that captures the [essence] of her character, from her [rugged looks] to her [captivating beauty], with [intricate details] that capture every nuance of her form. Overall, the image should capture the [bleak] and [desolate] nature of the [post-apocalyptic world], with the [piles of skulls] as a aftermath of a [battle] between man and machine., showing the complete scene with her [full body]. These skulls should be arranged in a [haphazard] and [chaotic] manner, symbolizing the [utter devastation] that has been wrought upon humanity. The skulls should be [partially buried] in the ground, with chunks of concrete and twisted metal protruding from the earth.
