A photo of a gothic Victorian woman, looking hauntingly beautiful, her platinum blonde hair adorned with black roses. She's dressed in a dark violet velvet gown with an intricate bodice. She's located within a desolate Victorian greenhouse, surrounded by wilted flowers and creeping vines. The glass panes are rain-streaked, diffusing the morning light, and the camera angle is straight-on, emphasising her captivating gaze.
