philippe druillet,moebius inspired euro comics art The Cosmic Scream: "In the dim void, a lone astronaut floats, helmet removed, face twisted in an eternal scream. Behind, an abyssal maw of a black hole stretches open, its depths filled with ghostly, wailing faces that mirror the astronaut's terror. The whole scene is consumed in shades of pitch black, cold blue, and suffocating gray. Oil on canvas, heavy and rough textures." Inspired by  and John Berkey Style, <lora:john berkey style:0.5>.
