In the background, a nuclear explosion impacting the skyscrapers of New York City, a mushroom cloud rising, buildings crumbling under the force, glass shattering, a testament to his scientific triumph and a horrifying vision of destruction.

The scene is chilling, filled with tension, a reflection on the darker side of scientific discovery and human nature. shallow depth of field, vignette, highly detailed, high budget Hollywood movie, sinister, dramatic, intense, unsettling
