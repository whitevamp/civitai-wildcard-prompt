Isshin, the Sword Saint is a legendary warrior and the founder of the Ashina Clan. He is an old man with white hair and beard, wearing a blue kimono with black patterns and a white cloak. He carries a katana and a spear. He also has a gun hidden in his sleeve.

He awaits Sekiro in the great grass field where he first fought Genichiro Ashina, his grandson. The field is covered with blood and corpses of soldiers who died in the battle. The sky is dark and stormy, and lightning flashes occasionally. Isshin emerges from Genichiroâ€™s body after he sacrifices himself to revive him using the Black Mortal Blade. He respects Sekiro as a worthy opponent and challenges him to a final duel for the fate of Ashina.
