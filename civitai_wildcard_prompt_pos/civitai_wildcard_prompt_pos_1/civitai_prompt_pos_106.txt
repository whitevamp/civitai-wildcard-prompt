Its formidable, bipedal silhouette shimmering in the harsh, unyielding solar glare, its carapace glowing with the hot radiance of sun-forged steel. Bundles of its solar-flare orange cabling, braided with crackling power conduits sculpted from solar crystals, wind down its heavily armored form, casting stark shadows in the daylight. Its ocular sensors, like dual solar lenses, mirror the relentless heat of the solar seas with their blazing, constant stare. Cloaked in dense, sunspot-black armor plates, carved with heliographic patterns and traced with golden circuits, it raises an elaborate solar disk shield, its surface rippling with a magnetic energy field, readying a formidable, sun-blocking defensive stance. Massive, sun-ray etched mech paws stamp heavily into the sun-scorched battleground. It stands on the edge of a solar flare, dominating a vast heliospheric battlefield, the blazing light of a million suns reflecting off its armor, casting a threatening aura in hues of gold and obsidian)))), (cinematic lighting, rim light, key light, fill light, backlight, ambient light, hair light, accent light, three-point lighting, volumetric light), (zoom out:1.3, depth of field, f/4 aperture, wide-angle lens, HDR, golden ratio, leading lines, framing, prime lens, color grading), <lora:add_detail:0.75>, <lora:more_details:0.35>, <lora:Niji:0.45> mecha, scifi, armor, niji, (3d model, robotic soldier, brutal armor, heavy metal design, closed helmet), <hypernet:dr0ne:1> (subdivision, cyber muscle, angular design, mechanical, carbon-fiber, high-tech, pistons, robotic frame, metal joints, rubber cables), <hypernet:LuisapSciFiHard:0.35> (scifi, hard surface, armor, metal bolts, robotic, industrial, structures, sub-d), <lora:epiNoiseoffset:0.5> (bloom, rim lighting, studio lighting, soft lighting, low key), <hypernet:sxzBloom_sxzBloom:0.25>, <lora:LowRA:0.5>, <lora:Robort:0.1> robort
