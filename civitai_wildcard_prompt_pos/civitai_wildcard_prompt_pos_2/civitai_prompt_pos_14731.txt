In the snow all over the sky, a girl walking alone in the snow, wearing red thin trench coat, with a white scarf, Bare legs, bare feet, Holding her body tightly,
her head bowed, her eyes closed, her mouth pressed together, and she was about to cry, Long white hair blows in the wind, The detailed and beautiful face was depressed,
step by step, behind is a series of footprints, the snow is very big, the biting wind blowing her scarf, the distance is unbroken snow mountains, in this evening, helpless forward.
