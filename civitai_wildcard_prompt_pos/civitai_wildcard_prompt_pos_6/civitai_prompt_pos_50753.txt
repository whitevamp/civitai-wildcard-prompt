Its imposing, steel silhouette bathed in the harsh, unforgiving lunar light, its chassis gleaming with the harsh reflectivity of titanium alloy. Bundles of its moon-silver cabling, intertwined with glowing power conduits made of meteorite, snake down its armored form, flickering in the cold starlight. Its sensor arrays, like two piercing searchlights, echo the tranquility of the night sky with their haunting, unblinking gaze. Cloaked in dense, cosmic-blue armor plating, etched with constellations and interlaced with silver conduits, it raises an intricate cannon, tipped with a radiant plasma coil, charging an ominous, menacing lunar energy. Heavy, star-etched mech boots crunch heavily on the moon-cratered battlefield. It stands on the edge of a cliff overlooking a vast lunar valley, the harsh radiance of countless stars reflected off its armor, casting an intimidating aura in tones of steel and azure)))), (cinematic lighting, rim light, key light, fill light, backlight, ambient light, hair light, accent light, three-point lighting, volumetric light), (zoom out:1.3, depth of field, f/4 aperture, wide-angle lens, HDR, golden ratio, leading lines, framing, prime lens, color grading), <lora:add_detail:0.55>, <lora:more_details:0.35>, <lyco:miniatureWorldStyle:0.4> mini\(ttp\), isometric world, landscape terrain, macro-enhanced, <lora:Niji:0.45> mecha, scifi, armor, niji, <lora:mshn:0.65> (mshn robot:0.65, mshn:0.35), <hypernet:dr0ne:1> (subdivision, cyber muscle, angular design, mechanical, carbon-fiber, high-tech, pistons, robotic frame, metal joints, rubber cables), <hypernet:LuisapSciFiHard:0.25> (scifi, hard surface, armor, metal bolts, robotic, industrial, structures, sub-d)
