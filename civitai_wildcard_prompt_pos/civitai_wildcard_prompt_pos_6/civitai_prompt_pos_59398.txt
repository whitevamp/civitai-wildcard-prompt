Within a glass jar, the wonders of the universe come alive. Bright constellations and shimmering stardust fill the space, surrounding a breathtaking nebula that emanates vibrant hues. However, the jar, now fragmented, reveals the aftermath of a curious cat's escapade. Shattered pieces of glass scatter across the table, reflecting the starry spectacle. The cat, with an innocent yet mischievous expression, stands near the broken jar, its paw suspended mid-air as if frozen in surprise. Through the cracks, the cosmic magic spills out, intertwining with the shards of glass, creating a surreal and captivating scene.
