1girl dressed in a 1950s-inspired dress, complete with a full skirt and petticoat, her hair styled in classic pin curls. She should be seated at an old-fashioned diner, surrounded by vintage details like a jukebox, chrome accents, and neon signs. Her eyes should be sparkling with excitement, her skin flawless and glowing under the soft, dramatic lighting. This scene should be captured on 35mm film, with a beautiful depth of field and a slightly blurry, nostalgic background
