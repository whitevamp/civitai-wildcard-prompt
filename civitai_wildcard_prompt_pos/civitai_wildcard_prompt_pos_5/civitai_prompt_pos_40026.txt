epic realistic, (dark shot:1.4), 80mm, Create a portrait of a woman with long, dark hair. She has a mysterious expression, gazing at the viewer with a slight tilt of her head. She is simply dressed, with an arm wrapped around a tree branch that also resembles a brain cell. The background features a forest of blue, impressionistic leaves, with an eerie white light shining through and a gradient shadow on the top part of the woman's face. Use a backlighting effect to add depth to the image.
